## Load Data

Let's keep working with the UMD courses and Maryland campaign expense data we used in the pre_lab.

```{r}
umd_courses <- read_rds("data/umd_courses.rds")
maryland_expenses <- read_csv("data/maryland_expenses.csv")
```

## Answer questions

**Q1.** How many departments have offered the courses with "Climate" in the title and at least one seat? Which department has offered the most? **A1. There are 32 departments that have offered the courses with "Climate" in the title and at least with one seat. The Atmospheric and Oceanic Science department has offered the most classes at a total of 93.**

```{r}
```

**Q2.** Of the departments listed in A1, which one is the most interesting to you, and why? **A2. I'm most surprised that the Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership department only has 8 class that include the word "Climate" in its title. I find this interesting because national and international politics seems to be pushing more towards climate change projects and policy reform. I thought that UMD would provide more opportunities to learn these practices.**

**Q3** Which departments offered the most courses in the Fall 2024 term? And which departments in that term have at least one syllabus posted? Answer both of those questions and then compare the top five departments - how are they different?

**A3. The department of Business and Management offers the most courses in the Fall 2024 term with 174 courses. In the term of Fall 2024, only the Journalism, School of Music, Business and Management, Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Information Studies departments have at least one syllabus posted. The top five departments - Business and Management, School of Music, Information Studies, English, and Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership - are all different in term of subject matter!**

```{r}
```

**Q4.** Using the Maryland campaign expenses data, change the datatype of the expenditure_date column so that it is a date and not a chr, saving the result as a new dataframe. Then create a new column for the month based on expenditure_date. Then write code that shows total amount spent each month by Wes Moore's committee (you'll need to search the data to find the exact name, and we're not looking in payee_name). Write a sentence describing the pattern of spending over time. **A4. Wes Moore's committee spent the most amount of money in the month of October in 2022.**

```{r}
```

**Q5.** Using case_when(), create a column in the Maryland expenses data called `spending_location` indicating whether each record spent money in Maryland or outside Maryland. For records that are in Maryland, make the new column's value "In-state" and for all others, make it "Out of state". Then write code that shows the total amount of money spent in each category and describe the results. You can do this in one statement or break it up into two statements (saving the new column to your dataframe). **A5 In the state of Maryland, \$77,723,146 was spent while the amount of money spent out of the state of Maryland is unknown.**

```{r}
```

**Q6.** Choose your own adventure: using either the UMD courses or campaign expenses data, ask and answer a question that is different than the previous ones. You can use one of the ones you provided in the pre_lab. **A6. There are 319 courses that UMD offers with the word "Food" in there names.**
